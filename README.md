# DIALECT

The __DIALECT__(**DIA**batic **L**ocally **E**xcited and **C**harge-**T**ransfer states) software was designed to calculate the excited state properties and exciton dynamics of large molecular systems, including strong light-matter interactions between microcavities and molecular assemblies. It is developed in the group of Prof. Dr. Roland Mitrić at the University of Würzburg.

# Documentation
A short guide, which explains the installation and use of our program is available [here](https://github.com/dialect-rs/manual).
